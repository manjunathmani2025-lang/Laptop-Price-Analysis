💻 Laptop Price Analysis
(GitHub README – Final Version)
 Project Overview

This project analyzes the laptop market to identify pricing trends and understand how features such as brand, RAM, storage, and OS influence laptop prices. A baseline machine learning model was built to predict laptop prices, and insights were visualized using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

 Business Objective

Analyze laptop pricing trends

Understand feature impact on price

Build a baseline price prediction model

Enable interactive exploration for business users

 Tools Used
🔹 Microsoft Excel

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns

Corrected data types and handled missing values

Extracted numeric features (e.g., SSD storage in GB)

🔹 Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature preparation and encoding

Built a Linear Regression baseline model

Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R²

Visualized actual vs predicted prices

🔹 Power BI

Created interactive dashboards

Visualized pricing trends by brand, RAM, and storage

Added slicers for Company, OS, and RAM

Designed a clean, readable layout

❓ Business Questions & Insights
1️⃣ Which brands have the highest laptop prices?

Brands like Razer and LG show the highest average prices.
➡️ Indicates strong premium positioning.

2️⃣ What is the general laptop price range?

Most laptops fall between €500–€1500.
➡️ Represents the mass consumer market.

3️⃣ How do features affect price?

Higher RAM and SSD storage significantly increase price.
➡️ Feature upgrades strongly influence pricing strategy.

🤖 Machine Learning Approach

Model: Linear Regression (baseline)

Target Variable: Price (EUR)

Why Linear Regression?

Simple, interpretable, and suitable as a baseline model

Outliers: High-priced premium laptops retained as genuine data points

📊 Dashboard Features

Average Laptop Price by Brand

Price Distribution of Laptops

Average Price by Primary Storage (GB)

Interactive slicers for OS, RAM, and Company

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning can be combined with visualization tools to derive actionable pricing insights. The Power BI dashboard allows both technical and non-technical users to explore laptop pricing trends interactively.
